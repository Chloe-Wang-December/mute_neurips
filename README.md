# mute_neurips
version of the MuTE toolbox that we used for the CauseME NeurIPS 2019 challenge


The MuTE toolbox, described in [this paper](http://10.1371/journal.pone.0109462) implements several estimators for the computation of Transfer Entropy, with two embedding strategies, uniform and nonuniform.

This repository basically mirrors [this one](https://github.com/montaltoalessandro/MuTE).

The MAPEFAST team who participated in the challenge is:

- Daniele Marinazzo, University of Ghent
- Riccardo Pernice, University of Palermo
- Luca Faes, University of Palermo
- Sebastiano Stramaglia, University of Bari
