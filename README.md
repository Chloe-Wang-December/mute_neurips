# mute_neurips
version of the MuTE toolbox that we used for the [CauseME NeurIPS 2019 challenge](https://causeme.uv.es/neurips2019).


The MuTE toolbox, described in [this paper](http://10.1371/journal.pone.0109462) implements several estimators for the computation of Transfer Entropy, with two embedding strategies, uniform and nonuniform.

This repository basically mirrors [this one](https://github.com/montaltoalessandro/MuTE).

There are two new methods with respect to the original version, nnnuela1 and nnnuela2, implementing the suggestion of [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0194382).

The MAPEFAST team who participated in the challenge is:

- Daniele Marinazzo, University of Ghent
- Riccardo Pernice, University of Palermo
- Luca Faes, University of Palermo
- Sebastiano Stramaglia, University of Bari
- Yuri Antonacci, University of Rome La Sapienza
